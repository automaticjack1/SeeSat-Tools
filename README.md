# SeeSat-Tools
New tools for use by the SeeSat-L member community

14:02 5/4/2019

Welcome to the SeeSat-L Tools Repository.

The goals of this repository are the following, to provide tools which:

    are amenable to maintenance over time
    possess approachable user interfaces
    are mathematically correct within the needs of the task
    are capable of being installed with reasonable effort
    
This repository additionally has the goals of being a focal point for documentation and
community support of the tools.

As of this writing, 4 May 2019, it is proposed to work on tools which will allow
data entry for photometric and PPAS records. This effort will replace older tools which
have become unmaintainable or whose utility has been challenged by modern operating systems.
Additionally, it is a simpler set of "training wheels" which the contributors can use to
determine how to best create these tools as a collaboration.

Your maintainer, a "benevolent dictator," can be reached at jad@texas.net.
